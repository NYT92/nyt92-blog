> _there is more repo than that this is just an example image!!!_

Before building [amvstrm](https://github.com/amvstrm/amvstrm), not many people actually built it. I have seen that there aren't many projects in github repo in 2021 _(BASED ON WHAT I REMEMBER DURING THAT YEAR)_. I still don't know why I start building one because of ``Too many ads`` or ``Annoying embed ads`` problems. 

## How?

Most anime streaming sites just scrape data from __Gogoanime, Zoro(aniwatch.to), 9anime(aniwave.to), AnimePahe, etc__. Among that __Gogoanime__ is one of the easiest website to scrape and many people are using it despite they have the lowest information.

Some websites like __Zoro(aniwatch.to) & 9anime(aniwave.to)__ have used a sophisticated method to battle against it using an encryption key, cloudflare, CORS, and more but it is still easy to scrape the data from it if you read the source code from the website (just disable debugger or use an extension to view the request).

When I build amvstrm, Gogoanime is the one that I use to get data. Now the new amvstrm still use Gogoanime to get streaming URL, embed, and small data but for the information data source, i use Anilist. I have planned to add more data sources like __Zoro(aniwatch.to), 9anime(aniwave.to), AnimePahe, and more__.

There are a lot of API and Node Module that will help you make your own anime streaming site like :

- [@Consumet/extensions](https://github.com/consumet/consumet.ts)
- [Enime.moe](https://api.enime.moe)
- [amvstrm/API](https://amvdocs.pages.dev/api/introduction)
- [Anify.tv](https://api.anify.tv)

and more...(you can add more if you make a pr)

## Will this affect the loss of traffic and revenue to the site?

I still think about that every time and I don't actually have an answer either. Many people still use their site without Ads blocker and visit them quite often to watch anime so I don't thing they will be shutting down. 

For [Animixplay](https://animixplay.to/), aniwatch.me, kissanime.ru, and 4anime.to have to shut down their website due to a lack of funding for the server and hard to maintain which is why most of them shut down. 

## DMCA

_I know it is a law but for fuck sake, we live in a poor country where the economy is so fucked up and those popular streaming service does not support it in every country. when every time a product launches it always gonna be US, CA, JP, and EU..._

DMCA hurts most of the streaming sites including anime streaming sites. Most popular websites like __Zoro(aniwatch.to), 9anime(aniwave.to), and many more__ have to rebrand or shut down to comply with the DMCA. Even though this shit is scary but I don't fucking care.

## Alternative

There are so many alternatives, so many that I could not fit into this but I will recommend this website if you want to use and watch them:

- [amvstrm](https://amvstrm.nyt92.eu.org) (OSS)
- [moopa](https://moopa.live) (OSS)
- [Enime](https://enime.moe) (OSS)
- [Animedex](https://animedex.live) (OSS)
- [Muse Asia](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGbshtvS9t-8CW11W7TooQg)
- [Marin](https://marin.moe)
- [Anify](https://anify.tv)

and many more...

You can find more websites on [TheIndex](https://theindex.moe) and they can help you find the real anime streaming website (Not the Adware one ü§Æ).

## Self-hosted

Self-hosted is the best option for anyone. It help cut down the cost of the server and to ensure if the site is down, you can use your self-hosted one to watch anime with no interuption. So that why I encourage everyone to use the open-source solutions.

Even though self-hosted is the best way to help the owner but I cannot guranteed 90% of the time if the data source is down, all the scrape anime website will be down too...

## Conclusion

> _fuck paid streaming services, üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è always the best... "im joking ofc"_

Anime streaming site will continue to grow more and more. I am a normal anime fan when I was 12 years old (start watch anime on gogoanime when i was 14 years old). After building amvstrm, I watch all anime on amvstrm till to these day. I enjoy working on amvstrm and support other people OSS work too. 

Thanks to my friends and everyone for using my website daily, really appriciated...
